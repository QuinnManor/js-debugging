# Hello Debugging
This is a simple exercise to showcase how you can debug in the browser with JavaScript. Let us begin!

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, do the following:

1. `git clone git@github.com:QuinnManor/js-debugging.git`
2. `cd js-debugging`
3. `git remote remove origin`

## Instructions
One of your colleagues has gone on vacation, leaving a project incomplete and full of bugs. You've been tasked with fixing these bugs and completing the app while they're gone.

In a nutshell, the app you're working on should greet users based on the name they submit in the input field. More detailed project requirements can be found below:

1. If no name is entered, the user should receive the following error message: "**Error: No name was entered!**"
2. If a name is entered, the user should receive the following message: "**Hello, [UserName]!"**
3. Your code should be dynamic so that any name entered recieves the hello message!
